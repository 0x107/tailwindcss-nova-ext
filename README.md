## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this extension other than Panic's Nova code editor for macOS. This extension does not depend on Tailwind being installed locally within a project, so it will also work when using the Tailwind CSS CDN.

## Usage

Enable the extension in the extension library within Nova.

## Known Issues

* Autocomplete suggestions are not accurate due to an issue with the current release of Nova. This is expected to be fixed in the next release of Nova. *See GitHub Issue #1.*
* Autocompletion of customizations haven't yet been added.
