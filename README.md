# Panic Nova Tailwind CSS Autocomplete Extension

This repository contains the Tailwind CSS autocomplete extension for Nova, Panic's code editor for macOS. Its functionality includes autocomplete for Tailwind CSS classes, functions and directives.

### Planned Features

* If Panic includes the ability to use color icons in their autocomplete functionality, the Tailwind CSS color classes will be added with color previews.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this extension other than the Nova editor, which is available only for macOS.

## Usage

Enable the extension in the extension library within Nova.

## License

This extension is not created or officially endorsed by Tailwind Labs. This is my first attempt at an extension and an open source project. The repo is public and available at https://github.com/jasonplatts/tailwindcss-nova-ext.git.
